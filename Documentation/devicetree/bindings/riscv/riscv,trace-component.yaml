title: RISC-V Trace Component

description:
  The RISC-V trace control interface specification standard memory mapped
  components (or devices) which support both the RISC-V efficient trace
  (E-trace) protocol and the RISC-V Nexus-based trace (N-trace) protocol.
  The RISC-V trace components have implementation specific directed acyclic
  graph style interdependency where output of one component serves as input
  to another component and certain components (such as funnel) can take inputs
  from multiple components. The type and version of a RISC-V trace component
  can be discovered from it's IMPL memory mapped register hence component
  specific compatible strings are not needed.
