	  This framework provides a kernel interface for the RISC-V trace
	  drivers (including both e-trace and n-trace). It's intended to
	  build a topological view of the RISC-V trace components and
	  configure the right series of components when trace is enabled
	  on a CPU.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called rvtrace.
